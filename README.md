# Airdrop

Airdrop is a Rust-based command-line tool designed to facilitate the distribution of ERC-20 tokens to multiple recipients efficiently. It reads recipient addresses and token amounts from a CSV file, validates the data, and processes token transfers on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features

- Load recipient addresses and token amounts from a CSV file.
- Validate recipient data to ensure correctness.
- Process batch token transfers using the ERC-20 `transferFrom` method.
- Simulate blockchain transactions using a virtual blockchain environment for testing purposes.
- Comprehensive unit tests to ensure functionality.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the main source code for the Airdrop tool.
  - `main.rs`: Entry point of the application.
  - `airdrop/`: Module containing the core logic.
    - `structs.rs`: Defines data structures like `Address`, `Recipient`, `TokenAmount`, and `Transactions`.
    - `processor.rs`: Implements the `AirdropProcessor` responsible for loading recipients, validating data, and processing transactions.
    - `errors.rs`: Defines custom error types for the application.
    - `utils.rs`: Provides utility functions, including a virtual blockchain for testing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo installed.
- An Ethereum node or provider (e.g., Infura) for interacting with the blockchain.
- A CSV file (`recipients.csv`) containing recipient addresses and token amounts.

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Samuel1-ona/Airdrop.git
